Question 1 - What is the most influential book or blog post you’ve read regarding front-end development?
"The Age of Spiritual Machines" is the first book which shifted my interest toward coding and front end development in general. I was inspired to begin
programming from there. This book describes the shift toward post biological society which began at the advent of programming. IT goes on to explain how imporant front end technologies will bridge the gap between programmers and those who have never heard of anything like it before. This text really conveyed the power of creation that exists in even very simple coding. Thus began my journey into front end. 
This was unlike anything else I have read in that it made me want to apply a technology to the world, it made me want to be part of the changes that were happening.

Question 2 - If you could master one technology this year, what would it be and why?
I would like to master the use of javascript in really intuitive problem solving situations within a year. I would also like to become really preociecnt in the use of Angular and React. While i can use both now, I would like to become much better.

Question 3 - Describe any front-end web application framework (preferably one that you use). How does it work? What are the upsides and downsides?
I am a huge fan of bootstrap. This is a framework which works by executing responsive design across scripts, html, css, and html5.
I would say the main upside the it is not only it's utility but also it's popularity. Because a lot of people are using it there has been a significant amount of work done on it. The down side is connected to the popularity as well: because everyone knows how to use it and change it, one could end up with many sites that look similar. So while I am excited to use the tool toi make my life easier I worry about the creative aspect being lost.

Question 4 - Write a JavaScript function that takes only one argument——another function——and returns a "memoized" version of that function. A "memoized" version of a function caches and returns the results of its call so that when it is called again with the same input, it doesn’t run its computation but instead returns the results from cache. Note that previous results should be retrievable in any order without re-computation.



function factorial (n is a non-negative integer)
    if n is 0 then
        return 1 [by the convention that 0! = 1]
    else   
        return factorial(n – 1) times n [recursively invoke factorial 
                                        with the parameter 1 less than n]
    end if
end function


Question 5 - Create a simple webpage that has a cow image in the middle (centered horizontally on the page) and a counter label below it. Add the necessary code so that every time you click the cow image, the counter is incremented by 1. The counter should start with a value of 0.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Cow Counter</title>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"> 
<script type="text/javascript">
    var count = 0;
    function changevar(){
            count = count + 1;
        if (count == 3) {
             alert('Done');
        }
    }
</script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <main>
            <header>
               
         <img class="cow" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Cow_cartoon_04.svg">           
                
            </header>
        
  
<script type="text/javascript">
var clicks = 0;
function linkClick(){
    document.getElementById('clicked').value = ++clicks;
}
document.write('<a href="#" onclick="linkClick()">Click Me!</a>');


</script>

You have clicked the cow <input id="clicked" size="3" onfocus="this.blur();" value="0" > times.
        </main>
    </body>
</html>


You should include a brief explanation of your code. Also, here is a URL for a cow image, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Cow_cartoon_04.svg, if you would like to include it in your answer.

Before answering the final question, insert a job description for a front-end position of your choice!

Your answer for Question 6 should be targeted to the company/job-description you chose.

Question 6 - If you were to start your front-end position today, what would be your goals a year from now?

Job Description: We are looking for a Front-End Web Developer who is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. Responsibilities will include translation of the UI/UX design wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the application. You will work with the UI/UX designer and bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as well as how it works.

My goal for the evolution of my skills as a developer is exponential growth. The way I invision my education within programming is built like a spider web, reaching out and connecting to endless other threads.
Growth looks like that within a year I will be able to create within Javascript on the fly not only to problam solve but to bring innovative designs into the world. Secondly growth looks like learning PHP and Python in the next year to expand my base of understanding. 
Thirdly it would be having completed the Senior Development Program with Udacity. And lastly it would be to ideally work within a technology company and helping create something helpful and beautiful that would extend into the future.
