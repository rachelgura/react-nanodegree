My Reads: A Book Lending App



About:

First project of three from Udacity's React Nanodegree. The app allows you to search for books located on an external database and add those to your book collection. Your book collection consists of three shelves of books - want to read, read, and currently reading.

Concepts :

the use of state, and how state is passed down from parent to child,
the use of JSX to build the UI of the app,
and how to use React Routing to route our app.
Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.

How to Open:

Clone the repository to your desktop
While inside the root of the repository, tun the $ npm install
After the dependencies have been installed run the command $ npm start
After that, the app should run perfectly!
